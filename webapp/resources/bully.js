    "Bullying is a form of aggressive behaviour – behaviour designed to hurt another. There is not universal agreement on the definition of bullying, but there is some consensus that it is aggres- sive behaviour which satisfies two additional criteria: (1) repetition – it happens more than once and (2) there is a power imbalance such that it is difficult for the victim to defend himself or her- self (Olweus, 1999).",

    "Interestingly, while it was previously argued that bullies have low levels of self esteem, other research shows aggressive people may possess good self-esteem [12].  In addition, whilst some bullies have social skills deficits, others have been found to be good at manipulating others [13].  Thus, it seems that rather than having social cognitive skills deficits, some bullies have heightened skills, which they use to manipulate and control others [14]. So, bullies may be good at manipulating others because they are knowledgeable about other peopleís feelings, and can predict the consequences of their behaviour on others. Such cognitive skills make ëleadersí of children who bully because they are able to take control over other children [15]",
