# nsv-demo

(**10/31/2018**: *Candidate for squash and marge with Alpha_Lantern*)

This is an adaptation of the NoSchoolViolence/Alpha_Lantern (https://github.com/NoSchoolViolence/Alpha_Lantern) for use by the Microsoft Consultant team in their presentation to the MS SLT on 9/13-14.

- It is currently set up with Javascript and uses Microsoft's v4 Bot Framework.
- Numbers were mocked for the purpose of the presentation to give the general gist of intent and function.
